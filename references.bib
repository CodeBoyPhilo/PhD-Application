              entities as nodes and relations among them as typed edges. Goal of
              the Question Answering over KG (KGQA) task is to answer natural
              language queries posed over the KG. Multi-hop KGQA requires
              reasoning over multiple edges of the KG to arrive at the right
              answer. KGs are often incomplete with many missing links, posing
              additional challenges for KGQA, especially for multi-hop KGQA.
              Recent research on multi-hop KGQA has attempted to handle KG
              sparsity using relevant external text, which isn{'}t always readily
              available. In a separate line of research, KG embedding methods
              have been proposed to reduce KG sparsity by performing missing link
              prediction. Such KG embedding methods, even though highly relevant,
              have not been explored for multi-hop KGQA so far. We fill this gap
              in this paper and propose EmbedKGQA. EmbedKGQA is particularly
              effective in performing multi-hop KGQA over sparse KGs. EmbedKGQA
              also relaxes the requirement of answer selection from a
              pre-specified neighborhood, a sub-optimal constraint enforced by
              previous multi-hop KGQA methods. Through extensive experiments on
              multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate EmbedKGQA{'}s
              effectiveness over other state-of-the-art baselines.",

              their representations through graph-based message passing. We
              evaluate QA-GNN on the CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA datasets, and

  abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual
              knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results
              when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to
              access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and
              hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind
              task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for
              their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open
              research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access
              mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue
              , but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream
              tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for
              retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine
              pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language
              generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is
              a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a
              dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural
              retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on
              the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence,
              and another which can use different passages per token. We
              fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of
              knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three
              open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and
              task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language
              generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific,
              diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art
              parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

  abstract = {Question answering over knowledge graph (QA-KG) aims to use facts
              in the knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language questions.
              It helps end users more efficiently and more easily access the
              substantial and valuable knowledge in the KG, without knowing its
              data structures. QA-KG is a nontrivial problem since capturing the
              semantic meaning of natural language is difficult for a machine.
              Meanwhile, many knowledge graph embedding methods have been
              proposed. The key idea is to represent each predicate/entity as a
              low-dimensional vector, such that the relation information in the
              KG could be preserved. The learned vectors could benefit various
              applications such as KG completion and recommender systems. In this
              paper, we explore to use them to handle the QA-KG problem. However,
              this remains a challenging task since a predicate could be
              expressed in different ways in natural language questions. Also,
              the ambiguity of entity names and partial names makes the number of
              possible answers large. To bridge the gap, we propose an effective
              Knowledge Embedding based Question Answering (KEQA) framework. We
              focus on answering the most common types of questions, i.e., simple
              questions, in which each question could be answered by the machine
              straightforwardly if its single head entity and single predicate
              are correctly identified. To answer a simple question, instead of
              inferring its head entity and predicate directly, KEQA targets at
              jointly recovering the question's head entity, predicate, and tail
              entity representations in the KG embedding spaces. Based on a
              carefully-designed joint distance metric, the three learned
              vectors' closest fact in the KG is returned as the answer.
              Experiments on a widely-adopted benchmark demonstrate that the
              proposed KEQA outperforms the state-of-the-art QA-KG methods.},

  abstract = {Knowledge graph reasoning plays a pivotal role in many real-world
              applications, such as network alignment, computational
              fact-checking, recommendation, and many more. Among these
              applications, knowledge graph completion (KGC) and multi-hop
              question answering over knowledge graph (Multi-hop KGQA) are two
              representative reasoning tasks. In the vast majority of the
              existing works, the two tasks are considered separately with
              different models or algorithms. However, we envision that KGC and
              Multi-hop KGQA are closely related to each other. Therefore, the
              two tasks will benefit from each other if they are approached
              adequately. In this work, we propose a neural model named BiNet to
              jointly handle KGC and multi-hop KGQA, and formulate it as a
              multi-task learning problem. Specifically, our proposed model
              leverages a shared embedding space and an answer scoring module,
              which allows the two tasks to automatically share latent features
              and learn the interactions between natural language question
              decoder and answer scoring module. Compared to the existing methods
              , the proposed BiNet model addresses both multi-hop KGQA and KGC
              tasks simultaneously with superior performance. Experiment results
              show that BiNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide

              ability to make presumptions about ordinary situations in our daily
              life. In this paper, we propose a textual inference framework for
              answering commonsense questions, which effectively utilizes
              external, structured commonsense knowledge graphs to perform
              explainable inferences. The framework first grounds a
              question-answer pair from the semantic space to the knowledge-based
              symbolic space as a schema graph, a related sub-graph of external
              knowledge graphs. It represents schema graphs with a novel
              knowledge-aware graph network module named KagNet, and finally
              scores answers with graph representations. Our model is based on
              graph convolutional networks and LSTMs, with a hierarchical
              path-based attention mechanism. The intermediate attention scores
              make it transparent and interpretable, which thus produce
              trustworthy inferences. Using ConceptNet as the only external
              resource for Bert-based models, we achieved state-of-the-art
              performance on the CommonsenseQA, a large-scale dataset for
              commonsense reasoning.",

              understanding (NLU). However, our preliminary study reveals that
              manual discrete prompts often lead to unstable performance—e.g.,
              changing a single word in the prompt might result in substantial
              performance drop. We propose a novel method P-Tuning that employs
              trainable continuous prompt embeddings in concatenation with
              discrete prompts. Empirically, P-Tuning not only stabilizes
              training by minimizing the gap between various discrete prompts,
              but also improves performance by a sizeable margin on a wide range
              of NLU tasks including LAMA and SuperGLUE. P-Tuning is generally
              effective for both frozen and tuned language models, under both the

  abstract = "{Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable
              capabilities in natural language understanding. While demonstrating
              proficiency in everyday conversations and question-answering (QA)
              situations, these models frequently struggle in domains that
              require precision, such as medical applications, due to their lack
              of domain-specific knowledge. In this article, we describe the
              procedure for building a powerful, open-source language model
              specifically designed for medicine applications, termed as
              PMC-LLaMA.We adapt a general-purpose LLM toward the medical domain,
              involving data-centric knowledge injection through the integration
              of 4.8M biomedical academic papers and 30K medical textbooks, as
              well as comprehensive domain-specific instruction fine-tuning,
              encompassing medical QA, rationale for reasoning, and
              conversational dialogues with 202M tokens.While evaluating various
              public medical QA benchmarks and manual rating, our lightweight
              PMC-LLaMA, which consists of only 13B parameters, exhibits superior
              performance, even surpassing ChatGPT. All models, codes, and
              datasets for instruction tuning will be released to the research
              community.Our contributions are 3-fold: (1) we build up an
              open-source LLM toward the medical domain. We believe the proposed
              PMC-LLaMA model can promote further development of foundation
              models in medicine, serving as a medical trainable basic generative
              language backbone; (2) we conduct thorough ablation studies to
              demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component,
              demonstrating how different training data and model scales affect
              medical LLMs; (3) we contribute a large-scale, comprehensive
              dataset for instruction tuning.In this article, we systematically
              investigate the process of building up an open-source
              medical-specific LLM, PMC-LLaMA.}",

  abstract = {Natural Language Generation (NLG) has improved exponentially in
              recent years thanks to the development of sequence-to-sequence deep
              learning technologies such as Transformer-based language models.
              This advancement has led to more fluent and coherent NLG, leading
              to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive
              summarization, dialogue generation, and data-to-text generation.
              However, it is also apparent that deep learning based generation is
              prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system
              performance and fails to meet user expectations in many real-world
              scenarios. To address this issue, many studies have been presented
              in measuring and mitigating hallucinated texts, but these have
              never been reviewed in a comprehensive manner before.In this survey
              , we thus provide a broad overview of the research progress and
              challenges in the hallucination problem in NLG. The survey is
              organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics,
              mitigation methods, and future directions, and (2) an overview of
              task-specific research progress on hallucinations in the following
              downstream tasks, namely abstractive summarization, dialogue
              generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation,
              and machine translation. This survey serves to facilitate

  abstract = "We introduce PubMedQA, a novel biomedical question answering (QA)
              dataset collected from PubMed abstracts. The task of PubMedQA is to
              answer research questions with yes/no/maybe (e.g.: Do preoperative
              statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass
              grafting?) using the corresponding abstracts. PubMedQA has 1k
              expert-annotated, 61.2k unlabeled and 211.3k artificially generated
              QA instances. Each PubMedQA instance is composed of (1) a question
              which is either an existing research article title or derived from
              one, (2) a context which is the corresponding abstract without its
              conclusion, (3) a long answer, which is the conclusion of the
              abstract and, presumably, answers the research question, and (4) a
              yes/no/maybe answer which summarizes the conclusion. PubMedQA is
              the first QA dataset where reasoning over biomedical research texts
              , especially their quantitative contents, is required to answer the
              questions. Our best performing model, multi-phase fine-tuning of
              BioBERT with long answer bag-of-word statistics as additional
              supervision, achieves 68.1{\%} accuracy, compared to single human
              performance of 78.0{\%} accuracy and majority-baseline of 55.2{\%}
              accuracy, leaving much room for improvement. PubMedQA is publicly
              available at \url{https://pubmedqa.github.io}.",

  abstract = "We present a new kind of question answering dataset, OpenBookQA,
              modeled after open book exams for assessing human understanding of
              a subject. The open book that comes with our questions is a set of
              1326 elementary level science facts. Roughly 6000 questions probe
              an understanding of these facts and their application to novel
              situations. This requires combining an open book fact (e.g., metals
              conduct electricity) with broad common knowledge (e.g., a suit of
              armor is made of metal) obtained from other sources. While existing
              QA datasets over documents or knowledge bases, being generally
              self-contained, focus on linguistic understanding, OpenBookQA
              probes a deeper understanding of both the topic{---}in the context
              of common knowledge{---}and the language it is expressed in. Human
              performance on OpenBookQA is close to 92{\%}, but many
              state-of-the-art pre-trained QA methods perform surprisingly poorly
              , worse than several simple neural baselines we develop. Our oracle
              experiments designed to circumvent the knowledge retrieval
              bottleneck demonstrate the value of both the open book and
              additional facts. We leave it as a challenge to solve the retrieval
              problem in this multi-hop setting and to close the large gap to
              human performance.",

                  requiring this kind of &lt;strong&gt;physical
                  commonsense&lt;/strong&gt; pose a challenge to today’s natural
                  language understanding systems. While recent pretrained models
                  (such as BERT) have made progress on question answering over
                  more &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; domains – such as news
                  articles and encyclopedia entries, where text is plentiful – in
                  more &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; domains, text is inherently
                  limited due to reporting bias. Can AI systems learn to reliably
                  answer physical commonsense questions without experiencing the
                  physical world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce

                  pretrained models struggle (∼75%). We provide analysis about
                  the dimensions of knowledge that existing models lack, which
                  offers significant opportunities for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
