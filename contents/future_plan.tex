\section*{Work Plan}

\textbf{1-12 months. }
Coursework, survey on relevant literatures and developing theory on information-theory based knowledge embedding.

\textbf{13-18 months. }
Develop and implement a basic prototype of the proposed method and conducting preliminary experiments.
Conduct preliminary experiments and studies on benchmarking datasets to evaluate and improve the performance of the proposed method.

\textbf{19-29 months. }
Design and implement the full version of the proposed method. 
Compare with related works and conduct thorough experiments to investigate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method on variaous settings.

\textbf{30-36 months. }
Continue to improve our model and examine the domain-generalisation capability by experimenting on various domain-specific datasets and QA setting.

\textbf{37-48 months. }
Conclude the research on KG-augmented LLM domain-specific adaptation. 
Work on the PhD thesis and prepare for the final defence.
