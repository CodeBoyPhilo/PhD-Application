\section*{Methodology}

To answer our formulated research questions and realise our objectives, we plan to conduct the research in the following steps:

\textbf{Survey on KG-augmented LLM generation methods. } 
We will continue to survey existing and emerging literature that leverages Knowledge Graph in LLM domain-specific adaptation to build a thorough understanding of the task. 
In addition, we will explore the availability of domain-specific KGs and datasets that can be used for evaluation in our research.

\hw{\textbf{Methodology formulation on information-theory based knowledge representation learning. } 
We will research relevant information theories such as Information Bottleneck~\parencite{IB, vib, gib} to design a novel graph learning algorithm that learns a sufficiently compact knowledge representation, filtering out superfluous information while maximising the mutual information between the graph and text heterogeneous representations.}

\hw{\textbf{Assessment of data dependency and model complexity. }
We will conduct thorough experiments and compare with existing methods to evaluate the magnitude of data dependency and model complexity of our algorithm. }

\hw{\textbf{Evaluation on domain-specific datasets. } 
We will evaluate our proposed method on domain-specific datasets, begining with the biomedical datasets including MedQA-USMLE~\parencite{medqa} and PubMedQA~\parencite{pubmedqa}.}

\hw{\textbf{Investigation of model robustness and domain-generalisation ability. }
We will continue to evaluate our model on various domain-specific QA scenario to investigate our model's sensitivity to perturbations in setups and the generalisation ability to other specific domains.}
