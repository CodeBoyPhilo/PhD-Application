\section*{Methodology}
To answer our formualted research questions and realise our objectives, we plan to conduct the research in the following steps:

\textbf{Survey on KG-augmented LLM generation methods. } 
We will continue to survey existing and emerging literatures that leverages Knowledge Graph in LLM domain-specific adaptation to build a thorough understanding of the task. 
In addition, we will explore the availability of domain-specific KGs and datasets that can be used for evaluation in our research.

\textbf{Experimental analysis on benchmarking datasets. } 
We will evaluate existing works on domain-specific datasets such as MedQA-USMLE~\parencite{medqa} and PubMedQA~\parencite{pubmedqa} to reproduce the results and investigate the caveats in current implementations to gradually formulate our algorithm.

\textbf{Theory formulation on information-theory based knowledge embedding. } 
We will research on relevant information theories such as Information Bottleneck~\parencite{IB, vib, gib} to learn a sufficiently compact knowledge representation that filters out superfluous information while maximises the mutual information between the graph and text heterogeneous representations.
